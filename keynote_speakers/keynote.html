            <h2>Madeshwaran Sekkarapatti Ramasamy</h2>
            <p> I have more than 12 years of research experience in developing smart polymer composite materials based on carbon materials (graphene, carbon nanotubes) and 2D materials (transition metal dichalcogenides, boron nitride) for applications in sustainable energy, sensors/actuators and as well as biomedical field. 
                My research specifically focuses on the following topics with the aim to apply in sustainable development goals:
                Functionalization and dispersion chemistry of carbon nanotubes and 2D materials (graphene, molybdenum disulfide, boron nitride, vermiculite) for polymer composites applications. 
                Developing smart 3D polymer composite structures using 3D printing and electrospinning techniques for intelligent tissue scaffolds and piezoelectric energy harvesting. 
                Constructing solution-processed 2D materials based thin-film optoelectronic devices (polymer solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells) for sustainable development. 
                Structure-property relationships in polymer composites.
